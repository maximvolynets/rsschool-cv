## Shortly about me:
During my last year at university, I got interested in programming. I began my acquaintance with Python, took several courses, did a couple of projects. 

Then I got interested in web development, and I began to actively study html, css, adaptive layout, js, everything related to web development in one way or another. 

I myself work in business, as a BI analyst. I don't want to stop there, so I devote all my free time to learning something new.
